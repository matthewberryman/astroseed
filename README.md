# astroseed

Takes images from [NASA's Earth Polychromatic Imaging Camera (EPIC)](https://epic.gsfc.nasa.gov/epic) instrument aboard [DSCOVR](https://www.nesdis.noaa.gov/content/dscovr-deep-space-climate-observatory) (in a Lissajous orbit at the Sun-Earth L1 Lagrangian point, 1,500,000 km from Earth), computes the SHA256 hash, splits that into a set of 32-bit random seeds, and pushes them onto an AWS SQS queue for applications where a random seed is required. To be evaluated in future research: the statistical properties of generated seeds, to gauge their usefulness for different applications.
